# City-Complaint-Portal
College Hackathon Project

City Complaint Portal is a public platform that allows citizens to report urban issues such as damaged roads, exposed wires, water leaks, vehicles violating laws, and other infrastructure or safety problems.
The portal helps local authorities identify and address problems faster, promoting safer, cleaner, and more sustainable communities in line with the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
